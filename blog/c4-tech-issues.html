      <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-mat-honan-password-hacker/">This article in Wired by Mat Honan</a> in conjunction with the coverage of many recent high profile hacks, and the great new TV Series on USA "Mr. Robot," has me thinking about security and the Internet. Before I started Dev Bootcamp, the term "hack" had a very nebulous meaning to me. What did it really mean to "hack" someone? What is the fallout from such an event?
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in my cohort is now more than capable of running the following line of code in their terminal, throw it in your IRB to see how long it takes to run:
      <p><img src="imgs/Screenshot 2015-08-23 18.51.29.png"/></p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty fast right? It's pretty obvious what this little line of code does, but other than counting from 0 to 9999, it has also just listed every possible 4 digit password that most of us use to access our iPhones (if we even have that feature enabled). Doing repetitive things like guessing passwords within a given range is what computers are best at.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm aware that iPhones have some measures to ensure a program this simple does not work, like limiting the number of guesses, and including some biometric functionality. There are many points of access in your electronic life that don't have these additional protections. This example is meant as a reaffirmation of what Honan describes in his piece, that essentially, the password is dead.
    </p>
     <p>
      Like many things in the digital age, technology has passed the password by. It is often hard to realize this fact until the time has long passed, and the personal example that Honan shares about his entire life being hacked in under an hour is a perfect example of how even the most robust passwords stand no chance against the efforts of those who wish to do us harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution to this problem of security, could be some new advancement, or a slow shift in the consumer preferences. At some point, the ease and convenience of the Internet may not outweigh the danger and discomfort caused by having an ever growing number of access points to your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is clear, from this article, other media, and cultural commentary, is that we are both more connected, and more vulnerable than ever before. The faster we understand this reality, the sooner we can devise a way to properly protect ourselves. Clearly, your cat's name along with his full date of birth isn't going to cut it (even if it's case sensitive).
