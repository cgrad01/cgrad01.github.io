<p>There was one sentence in Claude Steele's talk about stereotype threat that made this idea ring true for me - "frusteration is the ingredient".</p>

<p>Steele was referencing a colleague's experiment when he said this, referring to the moment that students would start to underperform as a result of stereotype threat. In the referenced experiment, two groups of black and white students were given an IQ test, one group was told that this was a test meant to measure intelligence, and the other was told it was just a puzzle. In the group that was primed to believe that this was a test intelligence, the black students performed significantly less well than their white counterparts.</p>

<p>Steele goes on to explain that during the test, when the questions start to get hard, and the student begins to feel frusteration with the difficulty, the threat of fulfilling a perceived stereotype surfaces in the mind of the student. It is this threat, that is theorized to contribute to the acheivement gap that has been observed between whites and minorities, and in some cases between genders.</p>

<p>As a white male I can't say that I feel that I have experienced this phenomenom in my life, and especially not in test taking situations. I can definitely understand how this thought process could contribute to poor performance in high pressure situations.</p>

<p>I have felt the frusteration that Steele is referring to, that moment when you begin to question yourself, and your worth. This is the moment that all the worst feelings and thoughts you have about yourself surface. I have had these thoughts about myself in moments of struggle, they just haven't been associated with my race.</p>

<p>Steele notes that white men, often have little to no racial identity, and this is how I feel about myself. I can't imagine the dread associated with fulfilling a stereotype that you detest and resent, but I would have to imagine that the solution to this problem, at least on an individual basis is the same that it has been for me.</p>

<p>Focusing on the actions you can take to move forward with the problem at hand has been the most useful practice for me. For example, if you are having trouble finding a solution to a Ruby challenge, think about the checking the Ruby docs, rather than thinking about how you should know this, or how dumb you are, or how you don't belong becuase you aren't smart enough for this. Think about taking small steps forward, and what you need to do in order to take those small steps.</p>

<p>Obviously enacting this practice on an individual level is only part of the solution to this problem. On a macro level, the only possible antidote to stereotype threat that I can think of is awareness. By teaching students about stereotype threat and its effects, we can hope to innoculate future generations against these feelings of dread. Hopefully, through education, students will just have to deal with the standard insecurities every individual has, rather than those bestowed upon them by racists and sexists.</p>
