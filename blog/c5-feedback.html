      I grew up playing many team sports, and over time, I have filled pretty much every role imaginable. I have been the captain and leader, I have been a bench rider and support giver, I have been the son of the coach, and I have been the whipping boy. I have tried to enter every pairing session with a readiness and willingness to play whatever roll I need to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sport I played most was tennis, with a good amount of that spent playing doubles. So the two-person team is a construct that I am familiar with, and I have enjoyed applying this structure to coding. Having someone to depend on, who is also depending on you, tends to raise my level of performance, and keeps me more fucused and aware than I may have been alone. I find it especially rewarding to find the solution to a problem through collaboration. There have been a few instances where me and my pair have been able to fill gaps in eachothers' understanding, and end up with something that is really exciting to have acheived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only bit of frustration I have felt thus far is with the legnth of some of my sessions. I feel like trying to rush a session is never a good idea, so I have tried to keep my pace slow and deliberate. This has caused some of my pairing sessions to be border-line marathons, and I think that developing some strategies for being more efficient when pairing is something that I could benefit from.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feedback process has been very exciting for me. I believe that self-awareness is one of the greatest qualities a person can have, and we should make a conscious effort to hone and sharpen this awareness. A great way to do this is through opportunities to receive feedback. Given the qualities that DBC has hammered into us (kind, actionable, and specific), I have been excited to read my feedback each week, and try to adjust my approach accordingly.
    </p>
     <p>
      The actionable items that I have recieved thus far include, not being too pushy, as well being open with my feelings and emotions. These have been useful cues for me and I keep them in the back of my mind whenever I pair. As a result, my sessions have been going very well lately, and I hope to continue to develop this type of emotional intelligence as we progress to increasingly difficult challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing feedback has been an interesting process. I am generally a person who is non-confrontational, and overly polite. Pointing out areas for improvement in others is something that I do not have a lot of practice doing, but I think I have been able to do an okay job keeping the DBC qualities in mind, as well as looking at my meta feedback results (how other students rate the quality of my feedback).
