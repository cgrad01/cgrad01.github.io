      The Internet allows people to collaborate in a boundless and powerful way, but anyone who has ever updated a resume knows how difficult it can be to keep track of the changes you make to a document over time.  I personally encountered the necessity for version control in my previous job at a law firm. The software we used created multiple versions of a document, limited editing power to one person at a time, and allowed you to access all previous versions of a document.
    </p>
    <p>
       The need for these capabilities in coding are obvious, and the functionality of git and GitHub provide an even greater level of version control than what I experienced in the legal field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git's ability to branch off of a base, or master, seems to be the key feature that allows for the incredible level of collaboration that exists on GitHub. Rather than having one active version like I did at the law firm, branching allows there to be many active versions, none changing the master until the process of creating a pull request, and then merging, is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pull request is also an elegant feature of the collaboration process. Once you think your branch is ready to become part of the master, you push your work to GitHub, which then creates a pull request. This step creates a review stage that is non-negotiable, which is great for creating a consistently high performing product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The branch feature is an upgrade over the other document management software I have used, as it allows for unfettered creativity inside of feature branches, while also creating an easily repeatable process for review of those branches before their eventual merge.
