      Positioning items using CSS can be a lot of trial and error. In my adventures slamming different shapes around my screen, I realized I was having better success using certain positioning settings than others. This was because I missing the fundamental definition of what these positioning features meant. I have tried to break down the 4 options you have when imparting positioning on an element, as simply as I can:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><b>STATIC:</b> This is what is assigned to an object that is not positioned. By assigning this positioning to an object, you are ensuring that some other positioning element is not accidentally moving it somewhere you did not intend. Various other factors, like the float, clear, and display attributes can affect where your object will land on your page, static positioning ensures that your item falls where it would with no explicit positioning applied to it.</p>
      <li><p><b>RELATIVE:</b> Relative to what? Relative to static! This attribute was initially confusing to me because I kept asking myself "relative to what?". The answer is that it is relative to it's static (or default) positioning. Adding top, bottom, left, and right coordinates to a relatively positioned object will just move it relative to where it would have been had you not given it any positioning at all.
    </p>
     <li><p><b>ABSOLUTE:</b> Absolute positioning is uncompromising. Like the name suggests it is extreme positioning, it will put the item exactly where you tell it no matter what. It is no longer in the flow of the rest of your document, it is acting on its own, where you tell it to be. This is a positioning attribute that is very useful, but should not be overused. Generally, flow in a website is a good thing, if you have a lot of items that are absolutely positioned, it creates a very dead and uninteresting looking site. I imagine an announcement message of some sort, as a good use of absolute positioning. Stick it in the corner of your page to remind your visitors of something important, almost as an aside or addendum to whatever your actual message and purpose is.
    </p>
    <li><p><b>FIXED:</b> Fixed positioning, is affixing your item to window or frame in which you are viewing it. The affect of this is similar to freezing the first row or column in excel, when you scroll, your fixed item remains. This creates a certain affect, which could be desirable in some applications.
    </p>
  </ol>
    <p>
    After researching this topic, I have learned that although positioning is very powerful, it can very easily be overused. This has been a good reminder to myself to use positioning wisely, so that your sight can have a natural flow to it. I have definitely misused these features in the past, and look forward to applying these definitions to fix past mistakes.
