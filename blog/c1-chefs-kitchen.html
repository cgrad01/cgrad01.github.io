    <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's talk</a> about the first days of DBC, and how the attitudes of cohorts have changed over time, made a lot of sense to me. It also eased some of my fears entering the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am admittedly a worrier, I have been conditioned to expect things to be too good to be true, and to imagine the worst possible outcomes. It's hard to say what causes this way of thinking, but at least I am aware of it. Hearing Shereef address BOTH of the fears I am feeling was comforting. However irrational it is, I can definitely confess to having both the fear that I am not good enough, as well as the fear that the cohort will hold me back.

      The difference between the restaurant  and cook mindsets reminds me of being on a sports team. You either buy-in, or you don't. The restaurant  mindset is described as the mentallity of a consumer, who expects to be given things according to a "menu" or set of expectations, is inherently selfish. "I paid for this, therefore I deserve x, y, and z." The cook mindset is one of a team player. "What can I do to make this work?" This is the question that most coaches wish their players asked themselves.
    </p>
 <p>
      What initially drew me to DBC was the focus and understanding of emotional intelligence. I have encountered problems in the work place before, and issues within a team are rarely because of a lack of traditional intelligence, and frequently a lack of social and emotional intelligence. It seems that DBC recognizes this fact, and is challenging us to confront this head on, which has me feeling inspired and motivated.
