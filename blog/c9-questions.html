<p>I have been equally impressed with both the accuracy of the answers on StackOverflow, and the diversity of answers given. My time learning at DBC has constantly reminded me that there are many ways to solve a problem, not all of which are necesarrily suited for your specific problem. The way in which you ask your question can greatly affect the type of answer you receive.</p>

<p>Before asking a question, there needs to be an understanding of who the audience for this question will be. I have had bosses who only responded with one-word answers. This was very annoying, but also forced me to ask more direct, definitive questions, so that his one-word answers could actually be helpful. I have also had bosses that required questions be asked in a very specific manner, and in a specific venue. For example, if a question was to be addressed to this manager via e-mail, there needed to be all relevant contextual information hyperlinked, and the question could not be open ended. If I needed to ask this manager a question where there may not be a succinct asnwer, this question would have to be asked in person, in his office.</p>

<p>Understanding the context in which you are asking your question, and who is likely to answer, can go a long way towards optimaly shaping your question. When specifically talking about coding, I think that doing a reasonable amount of research before asking your question is also very important. Many times, after doing some research, I realize there are many answers that for one reason or another, fall outside the scope of my specific quesiton, or involve modules or other workarounds that I am not comfortable with. Knowing this ahead of time can save me and my hypothetical answerer time and effort.</p>

<p>Luckily, I feel like I have had a lot of experience asking and answering questions, and am able to envision possible answers before asking a given question. This kind of role play has been very useful to me in the past, and I plan to game these scenarious out often as a programmer.</p>
