<p>A great source of conflict I had at a previous job involved the onboarding of a new employee, who had great credentials, and interviewed exceptionally well. Our team was in a time of transition, with an outgoing manager, and interim leadership. The new employee had a very specific view of what he believed his role was to be on our team, and pushed back on our attempts to maximize our efficiency by using him in a variety of contexts. As the senior members of the team, a peer and myself were left with the responsibility of managing this new hire who refused to complete many projects that we assigned him.</p>

<p>A phrase that I have found to be very true is "disappointment is equal to the distance between expectation and reality," in this case, our new hire's expectation and reality were separated by a wide gap. Either through conversations with our previous manager, or through general misunderstanding, our team member had a vision of the work that he would be doing, and when he was given tasks that were more simple, tedious, repetitive, or open-ended, he felt as though he was being improperly used. A symptom of this fact was that when assigned these projects, he would look to find flaws, rather than try to problem solve, and produce a finished product.</p>

<p>Eventually, after trying to work around this path of most resistance, we had to provide feedback on this employee to our interim-manager. After doing so, the new employee took offense at this input, and quit shortly thereafter. I felt a lot of emotions during this sequence of events. First, I felt frustration at not being able to get on the same page, and felt disrespected because my role as a leader was being discounted. I also felt confusion at not being able to get candid and open discourse between myself and the teammate, so that we could eventually get on the same page and work towards a better solution. Then, once the teammate quit, I felt regret and ineffective as a result of being unable to retain a employee who had a great set of skills.</p>

<p>Over time, I have learned that cultural fit is as important as technical fit when it comes to starting a new job. I beat myself up emotionally because I had squandered an employee that was a great technical fit. After discussion with higher-ups and peers, I am confident that I did what I could to create an environment that would work for this hire, but for a variety of reasons, this was an example where there was too much distance between expectation and reality.</p>
