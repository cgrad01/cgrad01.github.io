<p>In my Gregorc test, I was received equal weighting to both the abstract sequential and abstract random mind styles, and re-reading the table that describes these types was kind of eerie:</p>

<p>When I had first taken this test, it had been a while since I had been in an academic setting, especially one that requires the amount of consumption and coprehension that DBC does. Since I hadn't done rigorous learning in a while, these characteristics did not particular hit home as being especially accurate in describing me. After 3 weeks of DBC, they are surprisingly accurate. As the consumate pessimist, the description of "What's hard for them" feel especially applicable to my experience so far.</p>

<p>I have a lot of trouble experessing my emotions, and doing "sentimental thinking," but the peer pairing sessions have been really great at forcing me into these areas of weakness.</p>

<p>I have been preparing for the peer pairing sessions in a similar manner to the way I approach going to see a concert. If you go to a show with a closed mind, or with an a specific idea of how the session should go, you are increasing the liklihood that you are going to have a bad time. If you understand from the start that even though you might think you know what you are about to experience, there are a lot of variables at play that can alter both the performance and your perception of it. If you can allow yourself to either keep an open mind about what you are in for, you will be able to have a much greater enjoyment rate.</p>

<p>My peer pairing experiences have been massively positive because of the acknowledgement of my where my comfort zone lies, and that these sessions are somewhat outside of it. Keeping this open mindset has allowed me to start to feel more comfortable when thinking and communicating in an emotional way that is required in these sessions.</p>
