<p>Friendship - 5, Inner harmony-3, Challenge-4, Vision-4</p>

<p>Vision is a value I thought of because it is something that is very important to me, but I couldn't find a proxy for in the list of values that DBC provided us in the prompt. I define vision as some combination of self-knowledge, order, ambition, and wisdom. It is something I feel when the priorities in my life are properly aligned, and working together towards a purpose. It's the ability to see the plan that you have laid out for yourself, and to be happy, excited, and challenged by the steps that lie before you. In order for me to feel in sync with this value, I need to have momentum gained from past accomplishments, and have that momentum pointed in a direction that I believe is aligned with the other values that I find important.</p>

<p>Occasionally I am asked for advice that pretains to the value of friendship, but I find more frequently I am asked for advice about things that people percieve to be important to me, or things that people perceive me to be knowledgable about. This includes fitness, business advice, and professional development. I also think that maintaining good friendships allows these friends to ask advice about anything. If you are a good friend, one of the roles you have to play is that of the sounding board, the person that someone feels safe asking the questions they are afraid to ask others.</p>

<p>I am definitely a low-risk candidate for encountering stereotype threat at DBC, but affirmation of my values could surely help if needed. When I think about my values, it gives me a sense of self-determination. It gives me comfort to know that these things that I count as most important to me are almost entirely within my own control. I have talked in previous posts about the appreciation I have for process, and that outcomes should always be viewed with skepticism. This focus on process, and the things I can control, will be the helium to my self-esteem balloon while on-site at DBC.</p>
