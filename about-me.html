      Thanks for visiting my portfolio page. Learning about programming and development has been an incredible experience, and I am proud to have this site represent my journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in Mamaroneck, NY and currently live in Manhattan. I have also speant significant time in San Diego, CA, where I lived after I graduated from Villanova University in Pennsylvania. While at Villanova I studied economics, and was a member of its varsity and club tennis teams.

      In addition to programming and tennis, I also love music and fitness. When I was trying to think of theme for this blog, music seemed the obvious choice, you can find musical references and easter eggs throughout this site, I decided early on in this site's creation that I would regularly add touches that could reward the curious reader.

      My love for music truly began when I first learned to play guitar in my early teens. Initially, I was an uncompromising metal-head, but as I learned different styles of music, my taste expanded enormously. I can relate this kind of discovery through learning to my time at Dev Bootcamp. Ruby is definitely my Metallica - my first love - but I know it will not be my last as I continue to pursue programming as my next great passion.
