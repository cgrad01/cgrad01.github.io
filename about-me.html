    <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio page. Learning about programming and development has been an incredible experience, and I am proud to have this site represent my journey.</p>

    <p>I grew up in Mamaroneck, NY and currently live in Manhattan. I have also spent significant time in San Diego, CA, where I lived after I graduated from Villanova University in Pennsylvania. While at Villanova I studied economics, and was a member of its varsity and club tennis teams.</p>

    <p>In addition to programming and tennis, I also love music and fitness. I played guitar growing up, and still play on occasion, and created a music blog with my roommate in San Diego (before I knew how to code), that you can check out <a href"http://www.doodleandshimmy.com/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>My love for music truly began when I first learned to play guitar in my early teens. Initially, I was an uncompromising metal-head, but as I learned different styles of music, my taste expanded enormously. I can relate this kind of discovery through learning to becoming a developer. Ruby is my Metallica - my first love - but I know it will not be my last as I continue to pursue a career in programming.</p>

    <p>Before learning to code, I worked as a research analyst for a law firm that specialized in securities class actions and derivative actions. As an analyst, I was tasked with monitoring major equity markets, in order to detect extreme market moves by any equities held by the firm's clients. My job would then be to research whether this extreme event belied a violation in securities laws, and if so, put together the time line of facts that would make up the substance of the case.</p>

    <p>This experience gave me in-depth knowledge of financial markets, as well some specific nuances of industries like pharmaceuticals, energy, tech, and banking. Each complaint I helped file was like a case study about a different specific risk businesses face on a daily basis. This gives me a broad based business knowledge I plan to help shape my career in development.</p>
